ðŸ”¹ 1. Logged Tables (Default)
Behavior: All changes are written to the WAL.

Purpose: Ensures crash recovery â€” data changes survive server restarts.

Advantages: Data durability and crash safety.

Usage example:

sql
Copy
Edit
CREATE TABLE my_table (...);
ðŸ”¹ 2. Unlogged Tables
Behavior: Changes are not written to the WAL.

Consequence: On crash or restart, table contents are lost.

Advantages: Faster write performance since there's no WAL overhead.

Usage example:

sql
Copy
Edit
CREATE UNLOGGED TABLE temp_results (...);
âœ… When to Use Unlogged Tables?
For temporary data or intermediate processing where durability is not critical.

Great for performance-intensive operations like batch inserts.
